introduction=<strong>The Job Announcement</strong> is a business process-centric web application that implements the BPMN process extensively described as an example in <strong><a href="http://www.hanser-fachbuch.de/buch/Praxishandbuch+BPMN+20/9783446429864">Praxishandbuch BPMN 2.0 (Third Edition)</a></strong>.
observation=Please note that this application currently implements only the process up to publishing a job announcement (shown as "Stellenauschreibung" in the Level 1 process diagram below). We are nevertheless already implementing support for full process!

process.level.1.title=Stellenausschreibung - Ebene 1
process.level.1.description=This layer is called the <em>strategic process model</em> or sometimes the <em>logical-abstract model</em>. The main purpose of this level, is to give a very quick understanding of a process even if you have never seen a BPMN diagram before. The process model at this level must be syntactically correct but can be semantically incorrect given that the full details and semantics of the process will be discovered in <em>lower</em> levels.

process.level.2.title=Stellenausschreibung - Ebene 2
process.level.2.description=This layer is called the <em>operational process model</em>, or sometimes the <em>physical-concrete model</em>. The process model in this layer needs to to mainly clarifying requirements for IT-solutions in regards to process participants and integration with other systems. The process model at this level must be both syntactic and semantically correct since this level is a pre-requisite to arrive at an executable process in the next level.

process.level.3.title=Stellenausschreibung - Ebene 3
process.level.3.description=This layer is called the <em>technical process model</em> or <em>executable process</em>. The main purpose of this level is to get the process to be executed by a software process engine.
