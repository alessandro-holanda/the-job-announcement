introduction=This application supports the process of creating a job position announcement starting from the need of finding a new employee. A manager can start the process by requesting a new job announcement giving a brief description of her needs. She will then submit her request to the Human Resources department which will review and create a detailed job announcement with an optional Twitter and/or Facebook post. The job announcement can be reviewed and approved (or not) by the original manager. Eventually, the job announcement is published to Twitter and Facebook.
