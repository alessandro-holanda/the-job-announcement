introduction=In the process that goes from requesting a new position to be fulfilled until a position description has been published several participants take part with different roles and responsibilities:
gonzo.description=Gonzo is the manager of a business unit. He can start the process of publishing a job position by filing the need for a new employee and a description of the position to be fulfilled. Once he requests a new job announcement, the Human Resources department takes care of filling in a proper description and requirements for the position.
kermit.description=Kermit is the manager of the Human Resources department. He can take care of describing open positions that Gonzo has initiated and also of publishing job announcements once they have been approved for publication.
fozzie.description=Fozzie works at the Human Resources department and has therefore the main responsibility of taking care of the open positions that Gonzo (or any employee of other business units) file in the system. Fozzie will fill in the requirements for the open position and optionally a Twitter and/or Facebook message to announce the open position. Once Fozzie is done, he can submit the position description back to Gonzo (or the process initiator) for review.
