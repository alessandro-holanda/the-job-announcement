introduction=In this section you get to know the main participants that take part in the job announcement process with their different roles and responsibilities. While using the application you can switch from one to the other by using the drop-down menu <strong>on the top right corner</strong> of every page:

gonzo.description=Gonzo is the manager of a business unit. He can start the process by requesting a new job announcement. He needs to describe his <strong>need</strong> for a new employee and suggest a <strong>title for the new position</strong>. Once he requests a new job announcement, the Human Resources department takes care of <strong>specifying the requirements</strong> for the position.

fozzie.description=Fozzie works at the Human Resources department and has the main responsibility of describing the positions that Gonzo (or a manager of any other business unit) request.<br/>Fozzie fills in the requirements for the open position and composes (optionally) a Twitter and/or Facebook message for the announcement. Once Fozzie describes the position requirements, he submits his work back to the manager of the requesting business unit for review.

kermit.description=Kermit is the manager of the Human Resources department. He, like Fozzie, can take care of describing open positions that Gonzo (or a manager of any other business unit) has initiated. The Human Resources department is also a business unit and therefore Kermit can also request job announcements for his own department. What Kermit cannot do is at the same request a new job announcement <strong>and</strong> describe the position himself without the intervention of another member of the Human Resources department (4-eyes principle).

process.announcement.title=Job Announcement Process
process.announcement.description=All of the abovementioned participants are orchestrated in their work by a fourth "<em>participant</em>": <strong>the executable process</strong>.

process.publish.title=Publish Job Announcement Process
process.publish.description=In the following diagram you can see the expanded "publish job announcement" sub-process (called "Durchführung der Ausschreibung" in the German diagram above) that was shown as one single activity in the previous diagram.
