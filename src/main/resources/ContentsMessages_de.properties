introduction=In this section you get to know the main participants that take part in the job announcement process with their different roles and responsibilities. While using the application you can switch from one to the other by using the drop-down menu <strong>on the top right corner</strong> of every page:

gonzo.description=Gonzo is the manager of a business unit. He can start the process of publishing a job position by requesting a new job announcement. He needs to fill in the <strong>need</strong> for a new employee and a <strong>title for the position</strong> to be filled. Once he requests a new job announcement, the Human Resources department takes care of filling in a proper <strong>position description</strong> and requirements for the position.

fozzie.description=Fozzie works at the Human Resources department and has the main responsibility of taking care of the open positions that Gonzo (or a manager of any other business unit) initiates. Fozzie will fill in the <strong>requirements</strong> for the open position and (optionally) a Twitter and/or Facebook message to announce the open position publicly. Once Fozzie is done describing the position requirements, he can submit his work back to Gonzo (or the process initiator) for review.

kermit.description=Kermit is the manager of the Human Resources department. He, like Fozzie, can take care of describing open positions that Gonzo (or a manager of any other business unit) has initiated. He can also publish job announcements once they have been approved for publication. What Kermit cannot do is to request a new job announcement, describe the position himself and finally publish it (4-eyes principle).
